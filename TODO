Not in order of importance:
I would really like to see https://github.com/JavaFXpert/quantum-circuit-pygame implemented in the game if we have time... I like the idea of giving 'quantum control' to the player instead of just QRNG
There aren't animations for the sprites, nor should there be. Too time consuming! (This is really an anti-todo item)
Properly citing authors, group, etc. Some of this can be done post-hackathon for posterity's sake
Updating art (sprites, title art, music, etc). My taste SUCKS.
Making the game feel generally distinct from the original. I really like the original aesthetic but I would also like to make it our own. Also 'creativity' will probably be our best bet here.
New maps. Especially important to highlight entanglement (right now it's not very useful to the player). Flesh out jobro.tmx using Tiled (www.mapeditor.org).
Add some instructional images to the main page (like through a menu) to try and get that sweet sweet 'Utility of Concept' credit.
DOCS/PRESENTATION
Have fun! Add something goofy!
